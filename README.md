# SUDOKU-SOLVER-
This repository contains a Sudoku Solver implemented in Python. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions to any valid Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku is a popular logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle, and this project demonstrates the application of algorithmic thinking to solve it programmatically.

Features
Backtracking Algorithm: Utilizes a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible configurations and find the correct solution.
Input Flexibility: Accepts puzzles in a 9x9 grid format, with zeros representing empty cells that need to be filled.
Efficiency: Solves puzzles quickly by optimizing the search space and pruning invalid configurations early in the process.
Command-Line Interface: A simple command-line interface allows users to input puzzles and view solutions directly in the terminal.
Easy Integration: The core solving algorithm is modular and can be easily integrated into other projects or extended for use with different interfaces.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/JAYHN554/sudoku-solver.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd sudoku-solver

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x is recommended). No additional dependencies are required.

Usage
To solve a Sudoku puzzle, you can run the script and provide the puzzle in a specific format:
Copy code
python sudoku_solver.py
The script will prompt you to input the Sudoku puzzle in a 9x9 grid format, where zeros (0) represent empty cells. The solution will
