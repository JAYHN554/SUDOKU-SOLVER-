# SUDOKU-SOLVER-
This repository contains a Sudoku Solver implemented in Python. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions to any valid Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku is a popular logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle, and this project demonstrates the application of algorithmic thinking to solve it programmatically.
